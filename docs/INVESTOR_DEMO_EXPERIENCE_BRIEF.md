# RetroOS Engine Investor Demo Experience Brief

## Purpose
This document reframes the platform as a **retro OS engine** for shipping branded, scriptable, multimedia experiences. It provides investor-facing language for onboarding, in-product messaging, and live demo flow.

## Platform Capability Snapshot

### 1) Core OS Simulation Systems
- Browser-native desktop shell (boot screen, desktop, taskbar, start menu, context menus, windows)
- Virtual multi-drive filesystem with persistent user content
- Modular runtime for features (enable/disable/configure at runtime)
- Plugin architecture for externally packaged features
- Semantic event bus + command bus for low-coupling orchestration

### 2) App Ecosystem
- Productivity: Notepad, Calculator, Calendar, Find Files, Control Panel, Display Properties
- Creator tools: Paint, Script Runner (RetroScript IDE)
- Media: Media Player, Video Player, Winamp-style audio UX
- Communication: Inbox, Chat Room, Instant Messenger, Phone
- Games/engagement: Minesweeper, Solitaire, FreeCell, Snake, Asteroids, DOOM, SkiFree, Zork
- System apps: My Computer, Recycle Bin, Task Manager, Run Dialog, Help System

### 3) RetroScript + Event-Driven Orchestration
- Script files can launch apps, manipulate files, emit events, and present guided story beats
- Autoexec support enables startup choreography for campaigns and scripted tours
- Script + terminal workflows allow live, presenter-controlled demonstrations

### 4) Multimedia and Narrative Delivery
- Integrated sound/video playback inside the retro shell
- File-driven narrative assets (briefings, logs, clues, onboarding docs)
- Event-triggered notifications/dialogues for scene progression

## Investor Positioning Statement
**RetroOS Engine is a browser-native platform for building premium retro experiences—combining nostalgic UI, programmable interactions, and multimedia storytelling into a reusable product framework.**

## Updated In-Product Messaging Surfaces
- Welcome dialog now presents an investor demo highlight checklist.
- Welcome files (`Welcome.txt`, `welcome.txt`) now frame the environment as a demo workspace.
- Help app welcome + terminal docs now emphasize platform architecture and demo flow.
- Clippy messaging now acts as a showcase guide with demo-aware prompts.
- Script Runner intro now frames RetroScript as the orchestration layer for investor demos.

## Recommended Live Demo Flow (7–10 minutes)
1. Open **Help → Platform Overview** to establish product framing.
2. Open **Start Menu** and quickly tour app breadth (tools, media, comms, games).
3. Launch **Script Runner** and execute a short scripted sequence.
4. Use **Terminal** to inspect/show narrative files in the virtual filesystem.
5. Open **Features Settings** to demonstrate modular runtime controls.
6. Close with extensibility: plugin architecture + branded theming potential.

## Messaging Principles for Future Copy
- Lead with platform value, not nostalgia alone.
- Pair every feature mention with a business use case.
- Keep language “demo-friendly”: short, directional, and presenter-oriented.
- Reuse terms consistently: **RetroOS Engine**, **experience platform**, **scriptable runtime**.
